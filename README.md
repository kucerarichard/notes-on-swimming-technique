## Flow Attitude: Intro Talk by Zhao Youbin

    Next I will talk about the characteristics of Yang's Tai Chi. 
    Yang's Tai Chi and Yang Chengfu's finalization in his later years,
    merge with the memories of his grandfather inherited from north to south
    and his disciples have spread it at home and abroad.
    It is characterized by regular movements and clear movements.  (kinetic energy jin)
    That is 13 forms of Tai Chi it is very clear and clear in our movements.
    This is a technique and a feature of it.
    As for the internal change relationship,  it is changed on the basis of clarity.
    It has no superfluous movements.
    So he has a very clean momentum (jin)
    When he practices.
    The posture is steady,  the speed is even.
    Continuous,  slow as a thread.
    Which is another important feature of Yang's Tai Chi practice,
    especially in which the movement is continuous as a thread.
    Of course there are also such characteristics
    as internal and external integration,  stretching,
    and natural breathing and so on.   However
    it is a very important feature that the movement is like a thread
    and is continuous.   We all have the experience of life,
    in order to pull out the silk cocoon is to be careful,
    the strength of the hand is not too heavy or too light,
    and must hear the silk thread so thin this kind of strength
    to pull out.
    It raised a question for us what is the practice of Tai Chi?
    What he practices is perceptual movement,  sensory movement (kinetic energy jin) 
    which is the core technical feature of practicing Tai Chi.
    It can listen to strength,  including other touching and sticking.
    For a long time it cannot do without the basis of this sensory movement.
    Therefore I think that Yang Tai Chi is the most important starting point
    of continuous flow 
    Then let's explain it through
    Some actions,  it's strength is continuous and continuous
    The 85 form of Tai Chi is called Xungong Frame.
    It does not repeat about 40 movements.
    It is also a change of movements.
    The rest are repeated for about 25 minutes.  Normally it's about 25 minutes.
    In the whole process of the drill it was uniform in speed,  
    continuous in succession and connected in momentum.
    It is such a process,  but how does the process of its movement reflect such
    a continuous feeling of strength?
    It is mainly through the change of strength.
    The change of strength is in our hand walking, for example,
    our cloud hand walking this circle.
    This hand cannot be empty,  and its strength varies with the
    position and route of the gesture.  The change of strength should
    be uninterrupted in this circle. (fluency, uninterrupted change, continuous change)
    For example,  our cloud hand arm rotates this circle,
    this is the action we often practice.
    When the right hand gets up,  the strength point,
    we must hold the upperside of the arm to scratch the bone.
    The palm of the hand is dominated by the right hand,  and the left
    hand is the assistant.
    When the right hand gets up, it is the side.
    Up and to the right
    Most of the force is to turn out gently
    To produce an outward force.
    This produces a change,  the middle can not be broken,
    then if it floats out like this,  the hand will be empty
    and there will be no strength to develop.
    He should continue,  for example when two people go to this position with
    their arms wrapped around their opponents,  from the wrist,
    to the back of the hand, all the way to the inside of the wrist,
    to the side of the little finger and the arm bone,
    they should switch to this side and let it rotate and stick out.
    Don't break here.
    For example,  when you run here today,  the middle is empty.
    This is not good.  It must be a transition process
    from the outside of the wrist to the inside, and at the same time,
    we should pay attention to how the elbow falls
    to protect the chest,  so that we can create what is called pressing.
    What is called pressing.  Press down then this time is the little finger
    to the palm and then where to go to the inside of the radius
    to produce a feeling of copying and then go to the left side
    it coincides with the left hand the right hand to lift
    the left hand to press.  This is an anti-joint movement (opposing movement)
    Of course,  what we are talking about now is one hand.
    When our two hands move at the same time,  one hand is the main hand
    and the other hand is the assistant hand.  When the right hand is on
    the side,  the right hand is the main hand,  the left hand is the
    assistant hand,  he should follow the right hand to be real and the
    left hand to be empty,  and when you turn around,  the left hand
    will be the main hand again.  From here,  the right hand becomes a
    repetitive movement, and in this circle,   for the same hand it is
    continuous and winding all the time.  In this change,  the strong
    point of the sense of strength follows this line of change without
    an end point.  Continuously,  so there is no discontinuity 
    in the middle,  no indentation at all.  
    To produce such an effect then from the perspective of one arm,
    it is detailed,  then from the perspective of two hands, it is
    virtual and real,  when one hand is the main hand,  the other hand
    is the assistant hand.  But the deputy cannot be empty.
    For example if the right hand goes out,  the left hand is empty.
    Did not keep up with the strength of the scattered,  it still can not
    do a whole strength,  soft and continuous,  a whole effect.
    Change of the strength of the fist is constant.
    The strength of the fist is constant and it's a process of movement
    that changes between reality and reality.
    Your continuous change is the progress of repeated movement.
    This is the existence of this kind of mind when we practice Tai Chi.
    So we make a move and return a move.
    It also has a process of changing his strength.
    This is not empty,  and I will give another example to illustrate 
    that it does not take up more time.
    For example,  when we go out with our hands, the operation should not
    be done with empty hands.
    First of all,  the palm should be raised in the middle of the palm.
    First of all,  the palm should be supported.  Then,  when we go out with 
    our hands,   we should raise the five fingers and protrude the palm.
    Gradually unfold the palm to unfold it,  the purpose of unfolding
    is to touch the strength or to appear the strength of attack to output
    this strength.
    Of course,  Tai Chi is to explore and touch the strength,  so we need
    to be slow,  slow means to let you feel the process of strength change
    to let you feel the process of continuous operation and transformation.
    So first of all,  we need to lead.
    So this elbow joint needs to be released.
    Take the initiative to unfold it,  from the hand to the elbow,
    this elbow cannot drag the hind leg of the palm,
    he must first unfold it,  when you reach out,  the joint unfolds.
    Then,  in the process of unfolding, the tip of the elbow should be pushed up,
    and the wrist should actively give the palm a driving force.
    This is a change within him.  Of course, it is not a sudden change,
    but a gradual change of mind to command the feeling of these spinning
    movements.  Persistence is not enough.  Tai Chi requires an elastic,
    unfolding and developing movement process, so at this time your
    shoulder movement is very important.  The shoulder muscles must be loosened,
    and the shoulder blades should be pushed forward and bounced out 
    on the basis of looseness.  
    So what he called the whole process of pushing forward the depth,
    it is a whole movement,  it is a movement that runs through each other,
    and it is also a movement that draws strength from the head to the root.
    So the hands should be open,  the elbows should be loose,  the elbows should
    be free, and the shoulders should be comfortable.  Then the reverse is also
    the same,  there must be a process of first and then,  then with the way
    of civil and military is a relaxation of the hand out must be taken back.
    The change of Tai Chi is fully reflected in the square inch,  so when it
    is taken back,  the root and shoulder should be taken back first, and
    the shoulders should be loosened.
    This is the elbow that makes way and comes back quickly at this time.
    It's not good for you to carry your shoulders, or you can't walk,
    you can't live.   Then,  for loose shoulders and elbows,  you must
    hold the breath,  stick the breath,  or step on the breath.
    That is,  from the back to the middle to the front the strength is
    continuous.  In turn,  it goes round and round.
    When you touch it again,  his hand is in front again.
    It will go round and round forming the strength of Tai Chi.
    It is continuous.  Such a method of practice.
    [Torso rotation requires weight distributed on both feet.  The point is not to turn the
    foot out but to do a whole body movement which involves rotating the torso everything
    as a unit, it is an entire movement.]
    I would like to explain the basic practice characteristics of
    Yang's Tai Chi from this perspective, for your reference only.
    That is all I can say.  Thank you.

## Moderate hypoxic sets

- diminishing number of breaths per length
- diminishing number of strokes per length
- shorter distances can be sprints 
- with fixed or diminishing rest times or breath counts
- or intervals with time starts on-30, on-60 seconds

---

## Breathing (freestyle)

- while stroking look down
- neck is free and body swivels
- the head looks down and is stationary in space
- neck swivels and the torso rotates
- while breathing chin locked to shoulder 
- as if a steel pin had bound them together
- head and torso rotate and move as a unit

---

## The Buoy And The Balance

- balance and switch drills teach control of the buoy
- buoy is under the arm in the armpit area
- push down on the buoy and the hips will rise
- face down kicking while pressing on the chest and the side skating drills
- use buoyancy to surface and breathe
- then rotate torso to re-submerge head
- then release lock and neck is freed from torso 
- then perform any number of strokes
- arms always extend to front quadrant
- always the focus is on arm activity forward in the front quadrant
- lengthen your vessel and rag doll relaxed hanging balance
- supported range-of-motion: focus on the supportive aspect of the water
- movement pause-able and reversible
- try pausing and re-balancing in midstream

- using the left and right sides or hemispheres
- right elbow separate from left jaw
- left jaw separate from right elbow
- left shoulder separate from right hip
- right hip separate from left shoulder
- right foot separate from left hand
- left hand separate from right foot

---

## Stroke mechanics

- stroke is a sculling outsweep,  insweep,  pull-through
- practice basic sculling and bouyancy with treading/submerging deep-end drills
- roll over a log,  anchor arm in the water around a big log or barrel
- a strong scull through to exit to the air into arm recovery
- body-driven and rotation preserve momentum with a straight-armed recovery
- slightly bent and fingertip entry and a loose, non-stiff weightless recovery
- two kinds of recovery, straight arm can be used for sprints 
- and long distances without fatigue, or mix up recover styles
- straight arm must be combined with body-driven freestyle
- alternatively a relaxed, high elbow recovery, on a "wide track"
- with the fingertips just over the surface of the water with an early entry 
- drill with fingertip drag under water during recovery phase
- with a quiet slice into the water rather than momentum
- water supports the weight of the arm as it lengthens forward underwater
- elbow leads into front quadrant tipping balance forward with both arms 
- point of elbow leading forward of shoulders 

---

## Kicking 

- Use 2-beat kick with freestyle
- Kick opposite recovering arm and in unison with stroking arm
- 2-beat avoids too much stress on lower back from 4- or 6- beat styles
- opposite recovering arm will coordinate better with hip-driven torso rotation
- like tai chi, 3 limbs moving, one limb "anchored" in space
- focal point on alternating sides with stroking arm and kicking arm together
- while recovering arm slices into water in front quadrant
- during rotation shoulders widen and fill out their shape

---

## Butterfly 

- body-driven freestyle and fly are compatible 
- may be switched in-flight/mid-stroke 
- breathe out through nose continuously do not hold breath
- breathe while continuing into next stroke,  do not poke the head up to breathe
- keyhole shape, arms out and bent with high elbows holding onto a mass of water (end of the outsweep)
- anchor both arms in the water around a big log or barrel,  insweep pull over barrel 
- pull-through into butterfly arm recovery or pull into prayer for breast-dolphin
- transition to the fly from breast stroke with body dolphin instead of frog kick 
- breast-dolphin stroke at the end of outsweep pull the arms into prayer position instead of fly recovery
- fly recovery as you break the surface head and shoulder forward leading to breathe
- arms trailing and loosely and easily brought forward
- energy can be conserved by resting underwater in a gliding 'C' shape after hand re-entry
- relax, lengthen from toes and hang underwater in rag doll to control pace and energy spend
- maintain balance and line with forward hands as rudders while in glide 
- ratchet up distances: 200, 400, 800, 1600

---

## TOTAL IMMERSION FOCAL-POINT CUES

- Hide Your Head
- Lead with the top of your head, not your forehead
- Feel water flowing over the back of your head much of the time
- See the bottom directly under you, and not much that is forward of you
- Swim Downhill
- Lean on your Chest until your hips and legs feel light
- Rhythmically press in one armpit, then the other
- Feel completely supported by the water
- Lengthen Your Body
- Extend a weightless arm
- Be able to float your arm forward for a l-o-n-g time
- Reach for the far wall before stroking
- Put your arm in the water as if sliding it into a sleeve
- Keep extending your arm until you feel your shoulder touch your jaw or ear
- Practice Your Switches
- Make a hole with your fingertips and slip your whole arm cleanly through that hole
- Feel "archer timing" in your stroke
- Clear the water by the slightest margin on recovery
- Have your hand out of the water for the shortest possible time on recovery
- Anchor Your Hands
- Make your hands stand still as you begin each stroke
- Move your body past your hand, rather than pushing back
- Never move your hand back faster than your body is moving forward
- Swim faster with your whole body not your arms and legs
- Skate and Rotate
- Feel yourself slide effortlessly past a few a few lane markers before stroking
- Breathe by rolling to where the air is
- Drive the high hi down on every stroke
- "Look" at each wall with your belly button in each stroke
- Slippery Swimming
- Pierce the water; slip through the smallest possible hole
- Maintain a low profile, as if swimming under a very low ceiling
- Silent Swimming
- Drill or swim as silently as possible
- When increasing your speed try not to make more noise
- Swim balanced and tall
- Breathe rhythmically without interrupting your flow and while keeping a hand extended and anchored
- Start each stroke with a "patient hand" taking time to trap the water with hand/forearm before stroking
- Develop "gears" by establishing an SPL (strokes per length) range of three to four 25 yd/m stroke counts 
- For example, learn 3 paces, low/medium/high paces: 11/13/15 SPL 25 yards, 13/15/17 SPL 25 meters
- 11-17 strokes per length (SPL), calibrated precisely according to your chosen pace
- Swim 400-1500 meters without exceeding your SPL range
- Swim sets of shorter repeats in the lower half of your SPL range
- (repeats of 25-200 yd/m in sets that last 10-20 min.)
- Mix should become 50 yds drill and 50 whole stroke, then 25 drill and 75 whole stroke
- Specific focus at all times and keeping that focus from drill to whole stroke. 
- Skating with a focus on establishing "wide tracks" then focus on following those wide tracks in whole stroke

---

## FOR BALANCE

- Completely release the weight of your head to the water
- Imagine a laser beam coming from your head-spine line– keep it pointed forward
- Feel that the back of your neck is lengthened
- Hang your extended hand– keep fingers below wrist and wrist below elbow

---

## FOR LATERAL STABILITY

- Keep extended lead hand outside of shoulder
- Follow "Wide Tracks" with recovery and extension
- Rotate only enough for shoulder to clear the water

---

## FOR LONG, SLEEK BODYLINES

- Spear hand forward to a target located in Skating and reinforced in Switch drills
- Line up your body to follow your spearing hand down the track
- Keep legs inside the "shadow" or slipstream of your body
- Always have a hand forward of your head (focal point front quadrant)

---

## FOR RECOVERY AND ENTRY

- Ear Hops– Hop fingers over an imaginary bar coming from your ear, then into the water
- Marionette Arms– Hang hand/forearm from your shoulder like a marionette or rag doll
- Mail Slot– On entry, slip hand and forearm through a visualized mail slot forward of your shoulder
- Soft Hand– Entering hand should be relaxed enough that fingers separate loosely

---

## HOLD YOUR PLACE

- Enter fingers opposite the elbow of extended hand
- Pause hand– fingers down– for a brief moment before stroke
- Trap the water behind hand/forearm before stroking
- Hold– don’t pull– as best you can

---

## PROPEL EFFORTLESSLY WITH YOUR CORE

- Spear your entering hand past your grip
- Spear your hand through the target established in Skating and Switch drills
- Drive down the high hip as you spear
- Count strokes with hip drives instead of hand entries
- Drive opposite foot as you spear your hand
- Finish each stroke to the front

---

## BREATHING

- Bubble out immediately and continuously after inhale
- Blow out the final 20% more forcefully as you roll to air
- Use the spearing hand to take you to air
- Follow shoulder back with your chin and look past your shoulder
- Keep the top of your head down, aligned with spine
- Get taller as you roll to breathe; stay taller as you return face-down

---

## KICKING

- Legs should be as passive as possible (if you came to workshop with "busy" legs)
- Keep kick as small and "neat" as possible
- Try to close feet briefly as you spear
- Kick from "gut" and top of legs– don’t feel it in your thighs
- Synchronize left foot drive with right hand spear and vice-versa

---

## AND FINALLY

- Do everything as quietly as possible– drilling, swimming, increasing speed or cadence
- Never Practice Struggle

---

## KAIZEN EQUALS PLEASURE PRINCIPLE

- This section provides guiding principles for maximizing the value– and enjoyment– of every hour you spend in the pool (or open water).
- Expect improvements in capacity for fine distinctions in position and timing to increase steadily. 
- Focus on greater relaxation, especially when swimming faster.

### CLEAR THINKING

- *Intention #1*: My intention in every practice is to swim better than I ever have in my life. Setting the bar that high keenly concentrates one’s mind. Since I adopted that intention, I’ve enjoyed great fulfillment– and even excitement– in virtually every practice. A key to making this happen is to never push off a wall without a specific purpose.

- *Intention #2*: My intention on every set and repeat is to accomplish whatever task I set for myself (whether technique, stroke count, time, or some combination) with as little effort as possible. In conventional training, the goal is typically to work harder, to increase physiological capacity. But time and energy are finite, while opportunities to increase efficiency are virtually infinite. After more than 40 years, I’m still improving my sense of how to swim more economically. 

### FITNESS

1. A quality workout is one that makes good use of the body. T.I. practice makes better use of the body than conventional workouts, minimizing the chances of injury and increasing the likelihood that you’ll be able to do healthful training consistently.
2. Motivation matters. If you enjoy and are engaged by your fitness routine, you’ll continue for the long term; if you don’t enjoy it, you’ll lose interest. Kaizen– Continued Improvement– Swimming will keep your interest higher than conventional training that you do simply because “it’s good for you.”
3. Increasing intensity is always an option. Once you begin to master the basics of efficient T.I. swimming, you’ll find yourself able to swim longer– and faster– with less fatigue. 

### Kaizen Training: Priority #1– Conserve Energy

* **PHASE I**: ENERGY CONSERVATION
1. Make breathing routine so it doesn’t distract you while working on other foundations.
2. Create effortless support or balance by imprinting a neutral head position and the right position on the “track” for your relaxed extended hand.
3. Make long, “slippery” bodylines a habit by learning to “pierce the water” with your spearing arm and follow the “track” with your bodyline.
4. Make whole-body propelling movements a habit.

### TOOLS

- 30% Balance Drills to learn balance and imprint sleek bodylines
- 40% Switch Drills- Focus on minimizing drag and turbulence, and becoming “patient” in trapping water
- 20% Mindful Swimming (whole stroke with focal points) to transfer awareness gained in drills into whole stroke
- 10% Stroke Counting to measure your improvements in efficiency and compare the effectiveness of various focal points

### PRACTICE TIPS 

- Efficient, fluent swimming starts with exploring basic movements and positions with a sense of curiosity– and no sense of urgency. 
- Whenever you feel discomfort during a drill, your natural reaction will be some kind of compensation– craning your neck, sculling, kicking too hard. 
- These unconscious reactions imprint energy-wasting movements on our nervous system. 
- Patience; focus purely on sensation and awareness– aiming to reduce effort and increase flow. 

### Follow these guidelines:

- Short repeats. 25s or less for the first week or two, and seldom longer than 50s.
- Short sets. To maintain acute attention, change your focus regularly. Alternate tasks that require intense focus, with less exacting ones.
- Clear focus. Think about doing just one thing well on each length. 
- Break it down finely. (e.g. on Switch Drills, you could divide your focal points into soft arms on recovery, recovering arm deep and slow, leading with your elbow, slicing your hand to your target, and tipping your fingers down.
- Ignore the clock. Use deep breaths to regulate your rest interval between repeats. 3 to 5 breaths should be sufficient. 

### SWIMMING GOLF

We introduce the pace clock, but use SPL and perceived effort (heart rate) to measure the “cost” of any speed increases. Swim any given speed more economically, conserving energy. 

*Version 1*:  On successive 50s, swim the same time but reduce your stroke count. 

Example:

> 32 total strokes + 50 seconds = a score of 82
> 
> 31 total strokes + :50 = 81
> 
> 30 total strokes + :50 = 80

The goal is to repeat the same time on each 50, but to continue subtracting strokes, until you can’t shave any more from your count without sacrificing speed. 

*Version 2*:  On successive 50s, maintain stroke count, but descend your time. 

Example:

> 30 total strokes + :45 = 75
> 
> 30 total strokes + :44 = 74
> 
> 30 total strokes + :43 = 73

To improve your score you need to keep exactly the same stroke length, but take each stroke just a bit faster to shave seconds. 

### VARIATIONS ON SWIM GOLF 

- How many ways can you score? After you’ve established your “par,” test how many different stroke counts you can swim at a slightly higher score. If your record score is 77, can you swim a constant score of 80 at 30 and 31 and 32 and 33 and 34 strokes? Which feels easiest? 
- Take your Heart Rate or estimate your Perceived Exertion after a good score. A score of 64 with a HR of 120 is much better than a 64 with a HR of 150.

## Swimming Holes

- Look for swimming holes with current 
- snowmelt rivers
- slime-covered boulders (North Fork American River)
- Set up and launch from a boulder and crawl or butterfly 
- Use slime-covered boulders while using defensive swimming position
- No Standing, avoid arm, foot and leg entrapment.

---

## Defensive swimming 

- conserves energy
- float on your back and use backstroke techniques to navigate to shore
- keep feet on the surface and use them as shock absorbers to bounce off rocks
- over a large drop or falls curl into a ball to avoid entrapment
- grab breaths of air when available, before getting submerged
- laid back position 
- aggressive swimming to get from point a to point b 
- for strainer flip from your back to your belly and kick it into freestyle. Pretend you are a boat and 
- use ferry angle to cross fast moving current 
- to break an eddy fence, barrel roll over it 
- aggressive swimming is when you can't avoid a strainer
- go head first towards the strainer as fast as you can
- when you reach the strainer, push down on it and dive over the strainer

---

## Cold Shock

### In very cold water (around 5˚C), even strong swimmers are unable to keep afloat for more than a few minutes. 

- This is because ‘cold shock’ brings about rapid breathing, which leads to difficulty in co-ordinating breathing with swimming. 
- Many fatalities in inland water are probably caused by the victim’s inability to get out because of steep sloping sides.
- Lightweight everyday clothing can substantially reduce heat loss by preventing the continuous movement of cold water around the body.

### If you find yourself in cold water:
- Keep calm. You will probably experience “cold shock” which affects the breathing and coordination. It is possible that you will be able to regain control after a short time.
- Float on your back and adopt the HELP (Heat Escape Lessening Posture) position which will prevent the loss of body heat.
- If there is more than one of you, adopt the HUDDLE position to retain body heat communally.
- Hold on to support or float quietly facing away from the waves to prevent the water splashing on your face.
- If you can, find some way of getting out of the water as quickly as possible – onto a floating object – or the shore/side.
- Try and keep your head above water. Intermittent submersion of the head will increase heat loss.
- Do not swim unless you are forced to do so to keep afloat or to get clear of danger.
- Do not try to swim for the shore, unless you are a good swimmer and the shore is within reasonable distance e.g. 200 metres in cold water, 50 metres in very cold water.
- Do not move more than is absolutely necessary.
